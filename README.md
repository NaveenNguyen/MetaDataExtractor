# MetaDataExtractor

The Idea of this tool is to simplify the metadata extraction process from the different file types. The MetaData information is highly useful in penetration testing process and it is done in the footprinting phase.


Different python script will be available for extracting data from different file type.

Currently the extractor is done for PDF files.

The functions of metadataextractor:
  -> Using 'goofile' the pdf file link for a domain will be collected and stored in a text file
  -> The files will be downloaded to the system
  -> The python script will extract metadata from the downloaded pdf files
